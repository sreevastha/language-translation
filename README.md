# Translation with Text-to-Speech and speech-to-text

This Python application offers a user-friendly way to translate text or speech into different languages and hear the translation spoken aloud. It provides a choice between text input and voice input, making it accessible for various users and situations.

## Features

- **Text and voice input:** Allows users to either type or speak the text they want to translate.
- **Multiple language support:** Supports translation to any language supported by Google Translate.
- **Text-to-speech output:** Plays the translated text aloud in the target language, aiding comprehension and pronunciation.
- **Continuous translation:** Prompts users for additional translation tasks until they choose to exit.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-translation.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame gtts speechrecognition googletrans uuid
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the `trans.py` file:
   ```bash
   python trans.py
   ```
2. Enter the desired target language code (e.g., 'en' for English, 'es' for Spanish) when prompted.
3. Choose between text input ('t') or voice input ('v') for each translation.
4. Follow the prompts to provide text or speak into a microphone.
5. The application will translate the text and play the translation aloud.
6. You'll be asked if you want to translate something else. Press 'y' to continue or any other key to exit.

## Troubleshooting

- **Microphone issues:** Ensure your microphone is enabled and properly configured if using voice input.
- **Internet connection:** The application relies on Google Translate and Google Text-to-Speech, so a stable internet connection is required.
